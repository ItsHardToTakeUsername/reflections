What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder was created. For traking my changes ^^,

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

I should add file to the staging area. Buffer between dir and repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can make gif diff to see what changes I have done.
