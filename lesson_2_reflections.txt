What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder was created. For traking my changes ^^,

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

I should add file to the staging area. Buffer between dir and repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can make gif diff to see what changes I have done.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When I want to make a special version of existing project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

In a very cool way.
