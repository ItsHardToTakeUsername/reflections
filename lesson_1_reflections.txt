How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I saw all the different lines and manually found the one that have the bug.
If I'd didn't diff the files, I have to search the bug totally manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I'll have ability to restore backup for my code for any point of the time.
I can easily revert all buggy changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?

Manually pro: logical structure; con - it's not automatically.
Automatically pro: you'll always have backup, cons: it doesn't have logical
structure.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

A codebase is a big complicated system, so that's why we need to save multiple
files at once. But just a regular doc usually is independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

First, I use git log to see commits id. Then I use git diff for watch the
difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I always can revert all my changes!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to write buggy code and revert it :)
